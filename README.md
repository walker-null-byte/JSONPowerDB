## Description
The project is a web-based form that allows users to input various details such as roll number, full name, class, date of birth (DOB), address, and enrollment date. The form provides options to save the entered information into JSONPowerDB, a lightweight and efficient JSON based database.

The form includes input fields for each data attribute, along with buttons to perform specific actions. The "Save" button allows users to submit the form and store the entered data in the database. Once saved, the data can be retrieved and utilized for further processing or analysis.

Additionally, the form provides an "Update" or "Change" button, which enables users to modify the stored information if necessary. Clicking this button allows users to make changes to any of the fields and update the corresponding data in JSONPowerDB.

To provide a convenient user experience, the form also includes a "Reset" button. When clicked, this button resets all the form fields, clearing the entered data and allowing users to start over or input new information without manually deleting each field.

By combining the functionality of saving, updating, and resetting data, this project simplifies the process of managing and storing information in a JSON-based database. It provides a user-friendly interface for capturing and maintaining essential details, making it useful for various applications that require data collection and storage.
